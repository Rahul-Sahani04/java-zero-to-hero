# Java Basics

Welcome to the **Java Basics** section. This is where you'll start your journey into the world of Java. Here, you'll learn how to write and execute simple programs.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Basic Syntax** - How to write a simple Java program.
2. **Primitive Data Types** - int, float, char, etc.
3. **Type Casting & Conversions** - Converting between data types.
4. **Basic Arithmetic Operations** - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. **Control Statements** - if-else, loops (for, while, do-while).

## Example Programs:
- `HelloWorld.java` - A simple "Hello, World!" program to get you started.
- `CircleArea.java` - Calculate the area of a circle.
- `SimpleOperations.java` - Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
- `PrimeCheck.java` - Check if a number is prime.

## Exercises:
1. Write a program to print "Hello World".
2. Write a program to compute the area of a circle.
3. Write a program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
4. Write a program to check if a number is prime.
