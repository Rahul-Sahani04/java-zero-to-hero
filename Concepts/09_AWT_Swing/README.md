# AWT & Swing in Java

In this section, you'll learn how to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** and **Swing**. AWT provides basic building blocks for creating windows, while Swing extends AWT to provide more advanced features and components.

## Topics Covered:
1. **AWT Basics** - Creating simple applets and handling user input.
2. **Swing Basics** - Creating windows, adding controls, and handling events.
3. **Layouts** - Managing component positioning with different layout managers like `BorderLayout`.
4. **RGB Colors** - Working with colors using scroll bars.

## Example Programs:

### AWT:
1. **`LoginApplet.java`** - An applet that creates a simple login window with username and password fields.
   - **Concepts**: Using `TextField` and `Button` in an applet.

2. **`FontApplet.java`** - A program that lets the user change the font of text using control boxes for font name, size, and style.
   - **Concepts**: Working with `Choice` boxes and font manipulation.

3. **`CalculatorApplet.java`** - A 3-function calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication) implemented as an applet.
   - **Concepts**: Handling button click events in applets.

4. **`RGBApplet.java`** - A program that uses scrollbars to adjust RGB color combinations and change the background color.
   - **Concepts**: Working with `Scrollbar` and `Color` in applets.

### Swing:
1. **`SwingLogin.java`** - A Swing version of the login window with username and password fields.
   - **Concepts**: Using `JTextField` and `JButton` in Swing.

2. **`SwingFont.java`** - A Swing application that lets the user change the font of the text using control boxes.
   - **Concepts**: Handling events and changing styles in Swing.

3. **`SwingCalculator.java`** - A 3-function calculator created using Swing components.
   - **Concepts**: Handling basic arithmetic operations with `JButton` and `JTextField`.

4. **`SwingRGB.java`** - A program that uses scrollbars in Swing to display color combinations of RGB values.
   - **Concepts**: Handling `JScrollBar` events in Swing.

5. **`SwingBorderLayout.java`** - A demonstration of using the `BorderLayout` layout manager in Swing.
   - **Concepts**: Arranging components with `BorderLayout`.

## Exercises:
1. Create a simple login applet that checks if the username and password match predefined values.
2. Write an applet that uses scrollbars to change the background color of the window.
3. Create a Swing application with three control boxes to select a font, size, and style, and apply the selected settings to a text label.
4. Write a Swing application that uses at least five different controls, such as buttons, text fields, checkboxes, etc.

### Moving Forward:
After learning AWT and Swing basics, you can dive into more advanced topics like custom painting, event-driven programming, and integrating GUI with backend data using JDBC.
