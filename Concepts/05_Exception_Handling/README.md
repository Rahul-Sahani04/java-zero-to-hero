# Packages & Interfaces

This section teaches you how to organize code using packages and how to work with interfaces to achieve abstraction.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Packages** - Grouping related classes together.
2. **Access Protection** - How access modifiers affect package visibility.
3. **Interfaces** - Defining contracts without implementation.

## Example Programs:
- `PackageDemo.java` - Show how to create and use a package.
- `StackInterface.java` - Implement stack using an interface.

## Exercises:
1. Write a program showing the usage of a package.
2. Write a program to implement a stack using an interface.

Now, move on to **Exception Handling**.
