# Arrays & Strings

This section focuses on Arrays and Strings, two key components of Java. You'll learn how to store, manipulate, and search through data in arrays and perform various string operations.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Arrays** - Declaration, initialization, sorting, and searching.
2. **Strings** - String manipulation, functions like `length()`, `charAt()`, and `equals()`.

## Example Programs:
- `ArrayDemo.java` - Demonstrates how to initialize and print elements of an array.
- `Sorting.java` - Sort an array in ascending and descending order.
- `BinarySearch.java` - Perform binary search on an array of integers.
- `StringDemo.java` - Show usage of basic String methods.

## Exercises:
1. Write a program to initialize and print elements of an array.
2. Write a program to perform a linear search on an array.
3. Write a program to demonstrate any 10 String class functions.
4. Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending and descending order.

Once you've understood arrays and strings, proceed to **Classes & Objects**.
