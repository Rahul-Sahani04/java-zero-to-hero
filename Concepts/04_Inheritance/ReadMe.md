# Inheritance & Polymorphism

Inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. In this section, you'll explore inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Inheritance** - Reusing code from existing classes.
2. **Polymorphism** - Using a single interface to represent different types.
3. **Super Keyword** - Accessing parent class members.
4. **Abstract Classes** - Working with abstract classes and methods.

## Example Programs:
- `BoxWeight.java` - Inherit class `Box` and add the `weight` variable.
- `SuperDemo.java` - Use the `super` keyword to call the parent class constructor.
- `AbstractFigure.java` - Demonstrate the use of abstract classes and methods.
- `DynamicDispatch.java` - Demonstrate dynamic method dispatch (runtime polymorphism).

## Exercises:
1. Create a class `BoxWeight` that inherits from `Box` and adds a `weight` attribute.
2. Write a program to implement polymorphism using dynamic method dispatch.
3. Create an abstract class `Figure` and implement `Rectangle` and `Triangle` subclasses.

Continue to **Packages & Interfaces** after completing these.
