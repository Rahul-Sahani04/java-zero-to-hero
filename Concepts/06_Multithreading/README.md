# Exception Handling

In this section, you will learn how to handle runtime errors in Java using exception handling mechanisms.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Try-Catch Blocks** - Handling exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.
2. **Throwing Exceptions** - How to throw exceptions using `throw` and `throws`.
3. **User-Defined Exceptions** - Creating your own exception classes.

## Example Programs:
- `TryCatchDemo.java` - Demonstrate basic exception handling with `try` and `catch`.
- `UserDefinedException.java` - Create a custom exception class.
- `SavingsAccount.java` - Throw an exception if withdrawal amount exceeds balance.

## Exercises:
1. Write a program to handle an invalid age exception (age < 18).
2. Create a program to simulate a bank transaction and throw an exception if the balance drops below 1000.

Move on to **Multithreading** once you've mastered exception handling.
