# Multithreading in Java

In this section, you will learn how to create and manage multiple threads in Java, which allows you to perform concurrent operations and improve the efficiency of your programs.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Creating Threads** - Learn how to create threads using the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.
2. **Thread Priorities** - Understand how to set and manage thread priorities.
3. **Thread Synchronization** - Ensure thread safety using synchronized methods and blocks.
4. **Inter-Thread Communication** - Learn how threads can communicate with each other.

## Example Programs:
- `ThreadDemo.java` - Demonstrates creating threads using the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.


- `Multiples.java` - Prints multiples of 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously using threads.

- `ThreadPriority.java` - Demonstrates setting thread priorities.


- `ThreadSync.java` - Demonstrates thread synchronization and inter-thread communication.

Move on to **Advanced Multithreading** once you've mastered these concepts.
