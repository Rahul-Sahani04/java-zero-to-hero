# Classes & Objects

Now that you have a solid foundation in Java, let's dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this section, you'll learn how to create classes and objects, and how to use methods and static variables.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Classes & Objects** - Defining and using classes and objects.
2. **Constructors** - Default and parameterized constructors.
3. **Methods** - Creating methods and method overloading.
4. **Static Keyword** - Using static variables and static blocks.

## Example Programs:
- `Box.java` - Create a class to calculate the volume of a box.
- `UseStatic.java` - Demonstrate the use of static methods, variables, and blocks.
- `TestReference.java` - Illustrate passing objects as parameters.

## Exercises:
1. Create a class `Box` and calculate its volume.
2. Create a class `Triangle` and calculate its area using a parameterized constructor.
3. Write a program to demonstrate static variables and methods.

Once you grasp OOP basics, move on to **Inheritance & Polymorphism**.
